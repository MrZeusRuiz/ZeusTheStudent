				<p><b><strong>REFLECTION:</strong></b> Exploring Identity & Place, is a gathering of works by several artists curated by a group of 4 college students, Sarat, Steve, Francisco, and Zeus. The goal is to create a window through which the audience can peek into what it is that drives personality. Personality, Identity, and Place are meaningful and subjective concepts unique to the essence of humanity. Art is nearly almost a thread that binds all three. These are the trinity of what makes us tick.

					<br> <i>Artis bio by Zeus</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>There is beauty throughout this land of ours we call America. In the Southwest, you might find red-stained cliffs that contrast the bluest of skies while the white fluffy clouds split the frame to lure your eyes to the single lonely coyote atop a sand dune. That’s what Photographer Donovan Quintero is out looking for. </p>
				<p> Mr. Quintero is the man out in search of hidden treasure not likely seen beyond those who grew up locally. There are stories to tell through the lens and Mr Quintero is out exploring the land in search of them. The stories he finds often include people. His camera captures each wrinkle and imperfection on an elderly woman's cheek with such high definition that you can surely read the life she’s had. Instantly there are thoughts of lineage, motherhood, work, and love—her story has been captured and added to a catalog of other stories like her own. These photographs mean something. These are the photographs of the indigenous people of this land. </p> <strong>Significance</strong>
				<p> Mr. Quintero’s work during the Covid pandemic can now be added to the aforementioned captured stories. During the time when the entire world became reclusive whilst hoarding toilet paper, Mr. Donovan’s lens was shining a spotlight on the marginalized communities of Indigenous people. Again, the Native identity was left behind in a time of need while the rest of America hashtagged the phrase, “We’re all in this together”.

				<p> <strong> Camille Seaman | Photographer<strong> <br> <i>Artist bio by Zeus</i> <br> <br> <br> Camille Seaman is an American photographer known for her stunning photographs of natural landscapes, particularly icebergs and storms. She was born on July 22, 1969, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. Seaman has a deep connection with nature and has been passionate about photography since her childhood. She has a unique ability to capture the beauty and power of natural phenomena, often focusing on the relationship between humans and their environment. Her work explores themes of climate change, environmental awareness, and the fragility of our planet. <p><i>Significance</i>
                            <p> Without deviating from her passions, Ms Seaman explores identity through her lens. The sharp contrast between technology and traditional headwear is obvious—but look closer, there is a commentary to dive into. What does it mean to be “native” today in modern America? And who gets to decide?

				<p> <strong><b>Darren Solomon | Artist</b></strong>
					<br><i>Artist Bio by Francisco Ruvalcaba</i>
					<p> Darren Solomon is a Brooklyn composer who began his music career at the age of 19. He attained a music degree from NYU and went on tour with Barry Manilow for four years, where he began composing. He has done music for over 500 commercials, including commercials for Pepsi, L’Oreal, MnM’s, and more. Solomon has always loved the intersection between art and technology. Although he is a music-based person, this has not stopped him from dabbling in technology-based projects that push forth a combination of the two. His most well-known project is In Bb 2.0, which is a crowd-sourced project that broke new ground.
						<br>
						<br> Solomon is enjoying his multifaceted career in music, including performing, exploring applications for music in new media, composing for dance companies, and curating and producing live shows. </p>
					<p> <b>In Bb 2.0</b>
						<br> In Bb 2.0 (pronounced B-flat) Solomon takes Identity and Place and makes an example of it. In Bb 2.0 is an art project that is interactive, allowing the user to play and start various videos, which were crowd-sourced, to play together. No matter how one goes about playing these videos, they will always fit together, always sound in tandem, and can be looped in any way the user chooses. This art relates to Identity and Place by doing away with them. It gets rid of singular identity and the need to be nearby. All individuals, from different backgrounds and different homes, come together and create a musical piece in an awe-inspiring fashion. This piece tells the observer that no matter who you are, what your identity is, where you were born, where you came from, or what "place" you call home, you can come together with others who are different from you and create. </p>
					<br>
					<p> <b>maker/music<b>
                            <p>maker/music is a bit of an inversion of Solomon’s first piece of In Bb 2.0. Instead of being crowd sourced by the greater internet it was sourced via the students of Northern State University and community members of Aberdeen. Unlike the first project Solomon wanted to see what could be done by those in a close proximity and what they as individuals in the same place could end up creating. With over 70 submissions they narrowed down 12 and created something a-kin to In Bb 2.0. maker/music relates to identity and place by bringing a scope of a location, taking those who live in a certain area and making from that location. It relates to identity by having those who are self identified community members come forth to participate, being what it is that they can, and what they feel can fit. Each one having different tools they bring, knowledge of a different language, music, one is simply a person walking. All unique, all different, all individuals.

            <div class="content" style="color: burgundy;"> <br><br> <strong><b>Anselm Kiefer | Artist</b></strong>
						<br> <i>Artist bio by Francisco Ruvalcaba</i>
						<p>Anselm Kiefer is a German artist who primarily paints and sculpts. He was born in 1945 and features a lot of work that touches on the history and taboos of German culture. His work incorporates different elements such as straw, lead, ash, clay, and shellac. His works are characterized by their unflinching willingness to talk about the dark blemishes of German history. Kiefer holds his materials to value and holds a "spiritual connection" and aims to draw out the life that he feels is in his raw materials, he draws it out by transforming physically or letting it set in acid baths. In 1990 Kiefer was awarded the Wolf Award, in 1999 he was awarded the Praemium Imperiale by the Japanese Art Association for his life's works and in 2008 he was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, which he was the first-ever visual artist to ever receive.</p> <b>March Heath</b>
						<p>Anselm Kiefer's March Heath is a painting featuring a German landscape right after the end of World War II. It depicts a field that is reminiscent of decay and death and speaks to the viewer about the loss of what once was. This piece relates to Identity and Place by Kiefer being a German who confronts a dark aspect of history with the Holocaust and putting it into a visible place. To be able to know that your people have this history that is looked down upon and that you have to carry this burden, to speak of it and make it known and to learn from it. It's what makes it part of an identity, one he does not shy away from, one he holds to regard and transforms that aspect visually, an ugly truth. A landscape death, from inner turmoil. A display of self to the world and how they can be in tandem with each other.</p>
						<n>The Red Sea</b>
							<p>Kiefer's Red Sea is one of his most well-renowned paintings. It's a symbolic work of a hard and dark landscape with a seemingly sea-like appearance, with a boat filled with red in it. Above it, abstraction and the difficulty of making out what this painting's reality is. This painting relates to identity and place by some of the same means as the previous but with a different flavor. Here it looks almost as if the sea were to be a merging place with a room, perhaps alluding to horrors that have taken place. It tackles identity with the grasp of knowing what has been committed and not turning away. Taking a stand to its horror and acknowledging it for what it is, history.</p>

            <div class="content" style="color: black;"> <br><br> <strong><b>Edvard Munch | Artist</b></strong>
						<br> <i>Artist bio by Steve Monroy</i>
						<p>Edvard Munch is a Norwegian painter who is best known for his work of “The Scream”, which helped influence the expressionist movement. In which, some of his paintings dwell on expressing his emotional feelings as well as his poor mental state on a canvas. To which I myself found Edvard’s artwork to be somewhat relatable. Alongside that, he uses the curvy brush stroke and somewhat colorful or colorless palette to express these emotions to the viewer. In which, solidify his works as being expressionism and also a mixture of symbolism as well.
</p> <b>Anxiety</b>
						<p>Somewhat related to his famous works, “Anxiety” features the same fjord in “The Scream”, although now with a group of people staring directly at the viewer with terrifying dotted eyes and dead greenish skin. The skin now being more redder and the landscape being more darker than “The Scream'', it helps the viewer give the sense of what it would feel like having intense anxiety. Not only that but to have people just watching you gives you the sense that you are lonely and no one is going to help you. Overall this painting helps to identify what it feels like having anxiety to people who don’t experience such a thing.</p>
						<n>Puberty</b>
							<p>This is another painting made by Edvard Munch that features a young nude girl sitting on the bed with her legs and arms covering her private areas. With an odd looking shadow looming on the right side of her and finally her expression feels a sense of uncomfortableness and maybe fear. It basically shows the girl’s first experience of having her period, let alone experience the first stages of puberty. To which it helps the viewer visualize and basically identified the fear and dread of having not just puberty but a bumpy path towards adulthood.</p>

            <div class="content" style="color: black;"> <br><br> <strong><b>Diego Rivera | Artist</b></strong>
						<br> <i>Artist bio by Steve Monroy</i>
						<p>Diego Rivera is a Mexican painter who is well known for his mural art and also helped start a mural movement in Mexico, which would be later called Mexican muralism. Some, if not all, of his famous mural pieces cover Mexican history and culture up to that point in the 1920’s to 30’s, using influences of European renaissance fresco art and a combination of Aztec wall painting to create his murals. Another thing to point out is that he included themes of socialism like workers, farmers, communist flags, and even communist figures like Karl Marx into the murals due to the fact that Diego was a socialist through all of his life. And also that he would include himself as well as his equally as famous wife and artist, Frida Kahlo, into some of his own murals, as to maybe signified their marriage but also for their importance in Mexican art history.
 </p> <b>Sugar Cane</b>
						<p>Here we have a portable fresco by Diego Rivera that was made in the United States instead of Mexico. Where it shows indigenous Mexicans working in a sugar plantation during Spanish rule in Mexico. It basically shows the contrast between the foreground of the hardworking indigenous Mexican workers and the background of the brutal Spaniards looking over the workers, a great contrast nevertheless. It helps identify the key issues that help the push for Mexican independence later down the line. </p>
						<n>Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Central Park</b>
							<p>Here we have this mural art by Diego Rivera, where it portrays a very chaotic and surrealist scene in Alameda Central Park. Where there are many important figures in Mexican history all gathered around into murals and it would appear to feature different scenes taking place at once. From what I could gather it would appear that this mural is playing the themes of the complexity of Mexican history and the rich identity of Mexican culture into a big mural like this one. With the help of colors and composition of most of the people to enrich this chaotic and almost timeless scene.</p>
