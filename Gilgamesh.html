        <p> <strong>The Epic Of Gilgamesh | Clay Tablet</strong>
          <br> <i>Excavated by: Sir Austen Henry Layard (et al)</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>The first cuneiform tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh: A story that can draw parallels to Greek, Christianity, and contemporary literature was found by Sir Austen Henry Layard and his assistant Hormuzd Rassam.  In this particular fragment, the goddess Ishtar expresses her more than platonic interest in Gilgamesh. However, Gilgamesh rejects her advances. In retribution, Ishtar asks for retribution from her dad Anu. This trope can later be seen reflected in the Greek stories of Athena, medusa, and other Greek personalities.
        </p>
        <p> If literary merit was enough, the Epic of Gilgamesh would fare well reliant only on its prose. However, its significance transcends literary boundaries and extends to its geographical impact. The British Museum underscores this significance by highlighting, "The popularity of the story is proven by the fact that fragments have been found as far afield as Hattusas in Turkey, Emar in Syria, and Megiddo in Israel" (British Museum CITATION). This acknowledgment underscores the widespread influence and enduring legacy of the epic beyond its Mesopotamian origins. </p> <strong>Further Exploration</strong>
