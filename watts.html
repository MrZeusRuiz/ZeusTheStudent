      “The free man walks straight ahead; he has no hesitations and never looks behind, for he knows that there is nothing in the future and nothing in the past that can shake his freedom.<br>
      Freedom does not belong to him; it is no more his property than the wind, and as he does not possess it he is not possessed by it. <br> And because he never looks behind his actions are said to leave no trace, like the passage of a bird through air.”<br><br>
      ― Alan W. Watts
